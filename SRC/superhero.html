    <h1>Superhero</h1>
    <p>A superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural
        or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.
        A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the
        word superhero is commonly used for females also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such
        characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s. By most definitions, characters do not require actual
        superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.[1][2][3] While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero"
        is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting
        evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary
        or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters,
        costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not
        be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits. Some superheroes use their powers
        to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains, who are their criminal counterparts.
        Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy. Some long-running superheroes such as
        Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk
        have a rogues gallery of many villains.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p> Early history The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes
        as Robin Hood, who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized
        the idea of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed
        pulp fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936)
        began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character
        Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8] In the 1930s, both trends came together
        in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10] (visualized in painted panels
        used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician[11][12][13] (1934), Superman in
        1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books.</p>
    <h3>Common Traits</h3>
    <p>Many superhero characters display the following traits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extraordinary powers or abilities. Superhero powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced
            senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird, the Phantom
            and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage techniques,
            and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical weapons or technology,
            such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed by Green Arrow
            and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or device (e.g.
            Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's
            adamantium claws).</li>

            adamantium claws).</li>
        <li>A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman),
            a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in justice and humanitarian
            service (e.g. Superman).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More common traits:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A <strong>rogues</strong> gallery consisting of enemies that he/she fights repeatedly. In some cases superheroes
            begin by fighting run-of-the-mill criminals before supervillains surface in their respective story lines. In
            many cases the hero is in part responsible for the appearance of these supervillains (the Scorpion was created
            as the perfect enemy to defeat Spider-Man; the Sentinels were designed to hunt mutants who often represent the
            protagonists of Marvel stories; and characters in Batman's comics often accuse him of inadvertently creating
            the villains he fights). Often superheroes have a recurring archenemy who is especially threatening, or a nemesis
            who is depicted as a doppelganger or foil (e.g. Wolverine is outmatched physically by Sabretooth, who embraces
            his savage instincts while the former attempts to suppress his; the psychopathic Reverse-Flash's costume and
            abilities are very similar to the Flash's; the Joker is flamboyant and colorful in contrast to the moody, grim
            Batman. Magneto is restless and hostile in contrast to the calm and peaceful Professor X.)</li>
        <li>Independent wealth (e.g. Batman's family fortune, the X-Men's patron Professor X, Iron Man's father's weapon and
            technology company) or an occupation that allows for minimal supervision (e.g. Spider-Man's civilian job as a
            freelance photographer).</li>
        <li>Normal, human flaws like extravagance (Tony Stark), aggression (Wolverine) or a dysfunctional family (very common:
            e.g. Batman, Magneto).</li>
